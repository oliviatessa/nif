If you need to further customize this environment (e.g., install additional
packages, or upgrade a particular package),
you should first clone this environment as follows:
    conda create --prefix <path to a dir in which you can write> --clone
$AI_ENV
Then activate the newly spawned environment and proceed with your
customization.

To get further help with conda usage, you can try one of the following:
    conda -h
    conda <command> -h

Activate the module
-------------------
[1;32mNew!:[0m You are NOT required to manually activate this module anymore.

It should get activated automatically after running the module load command
since the following commands are being run on your behalf:
