# some ipynb files

1. simple_1d_wave [DONE]
	- it will include simple training, output of p_to_lr, output of lr_to_w
    - restore_then_fine_tune_with_lbfgs

2. multi-scale example
    - simple 2D turbulence snapshot, compare the result with not using
    multi-scale

3. extracting linear representation in fluids
    - flow over cylinder. compare the result with not using
    multi-scale.
    - p_to_lr, reweighting as well
