# some ipynb files

1. simple_1d_wave [DONE]
	- it will include simple training, output of p_to_lr, output of lr_to_w

2. restore_then_fine_tune_with_lbfgs
	- with output of p_to_lr, lr_to_w, as well

3. multi-scale example
    - simple 2D turbulence snapshot, compare the result with not using
    multi-scale

4. extracting linear representation in fluids
    - flow over cylinder. compare the result with not using
    multi-scale.
    - p_to_lr, reweighting as well
